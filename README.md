The old-version package
=======================

A general library for representation and manipulation of versions.

This version of the module is forked from base, preserving the versionTags
field of the Version type that will be removed in GHC 7.12 (cf.
<https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/2496>).
